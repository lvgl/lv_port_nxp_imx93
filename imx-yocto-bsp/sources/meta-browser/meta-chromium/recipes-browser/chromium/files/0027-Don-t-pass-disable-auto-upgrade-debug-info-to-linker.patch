Subject: [PATCH] Don't pass disable-auto-upgrade-debug-info to linker

The version of aarch64-oe-linux-ld.lld we use on dunfell, kirkstone, and
mickledore doesn't support this flag. Thus, we mustn't pass it if we
want to avoid an "Unknown command line argument" linker error that stops
the build.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate

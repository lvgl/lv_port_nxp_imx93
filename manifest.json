    "description": "The i.MX 93 applications processors are the first in the i.MX portfolio to integrate the scalable Arm Cortex-A55 core, bringing performance and energy efficiency to Linux®-based edge applications and the Arm Ethos™-U65 microNPU, enabling developers to create more capable, cost-effective and energy-efficient ML applications. The i.MX 93 EVK for 11x11mm sample provides a platform for comprehensive evaluation of the i.MX 93 applications processors and also includes the ability to measure power consumption on the power rails.
